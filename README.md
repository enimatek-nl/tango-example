# tango-example

### Run the example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enimatek-nl/tango-example
make run
```

### Info
This example consists of a _server.go_ component hosting a simple Todo API.

Tango is used on the client side in a static page that is presented by the _server.go_ exposing the _web/static/_ directory.

The spa part is generated by running the _make_ command. It will put a _web.wasm_ into the static directory.

Check _web.go_ for the Tango implementation.
